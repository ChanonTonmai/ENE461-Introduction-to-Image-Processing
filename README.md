# ENE461 Introduction to Image Processing

This is the ENE461 Introduction to Image Processing in King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Thailand.
Teaching by Asst. Prof. Werapol Jeracharit                                                                    
Semester 2/2016

**Class1** : Talk about convert color image to grayscale image, histogram and binary image                                       
**HW1** : Convert color image to grayscale image without matlab function, plot histogram and show binary image

**Class2** : Talk about auto threshold using different method and blob labeling                                              
**HW2** : 

1. Using auto threshold to convert grayscale image to binary image using maximum normal line method         
2. Using auto threshold to convert grayscale image to binary image using average intensity method                         
3. Blob labeling without using matlab function 
* (Extra) Using auto threshold to convert grayscale image to binary image using your own method
