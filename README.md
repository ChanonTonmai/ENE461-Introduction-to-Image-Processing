# ENE461-Introduction-to-Image-Processing-

This is the ENE461 Introduction to Image Processing in King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, Thailand.
Teaching by Asst. Prof. Werapol Jeracharit                                                                    
Semester 2/2016

*Class1 : Talk about convert color image to grayscale image, histogram and binary image *                                        
*HW1 : Convert color image to grayscale image without matlab function, plot histogram and show binary image*

*Class2 : Talk about auto threshold using different method and blob labeling   *                                            
*HW2 : 1. Using auto threshold to convert grayscale image to binary image using maximum normal line method  *       
      2. Using auto threshold to convert grayscale image to binary image using average intensity method  *                    
      (extra) Using auto threshold to convert grayscale image to binary image using your own method                           
      3. blob labeling without using matlab function
